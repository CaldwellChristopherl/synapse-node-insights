  "background": "Goblins are diminutive creatures using salvaged technology, strange mutations, and sheer weight of numbers. Emerging from their remote planet in the wake of a devastating nuclear blast that wiped out the human colonists on the surface, the Goblins have wasted little time spreading out to nearby worlds and scavenging any technology they find.\n\nThey are forever seeking new and intriguing life forms and technology, but their penchant for destruction often results in them leaving their new homes every bit as irradiated as their first.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Goblins long dwelt deep beneath the surface of their world, emerging to the surface only in times of desperation to forage and hunt what they could from the surface. None know for certain what initially drove them underground; some Goblin legends speak of a great war, but most claim that their ancestors have always lived this way. For much of their history, their world was ignored by the larger species until it came to be settled by a group of Human renegades seeking a world where they could operate outside of the confines of the Great Human Alliance.\n\nThe Goblins readily embraced their new neighbours, emerging at night to visit the ever-growing Human cities. The Humans and Goblins formed a strange friendship, with Goblins offering help and supplies to the newly settled colonists while the Humans gave them gadgets and tools. Close to a century of collaboration ended with a series of earth-shaking explosions that nearly sealed them forever inside of their caves.\n\nSeeking to escape their now crumbling homes, the Goblins fled onto the surface. There, they discovered that the Humans had disappeared but left behind a wealth of technology and infrastructure for them to use, though much of it was badly in need of their unique touch for repairs, and other parts seemed to bring on strange changes in the Goblins. Some saw this as another odd gift left by their former companions, while others exercised greater caution.\n\nRemembering that the Humans came from the stars, the Goblins wasted no time in seeking out and assembling space-worthy ships to seek out their companions. Eventually, they did encounter Humans among the stars, but these ones didn’t recognise the Goblins and had little time for their antics, treating them as annoyances rather than friends. Dejected but not unwilling to give up hope of reunion, the Goblins continue to seek out their old friends and new gadgets among the stars, even as many find their chaotic outlook to be more dangerous than endearing.\n\nWhat treasures will you find among the stars?"
