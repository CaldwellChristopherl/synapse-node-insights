  "background": "Jackals are species of aliens who resemble humanoid canids, and use technology built from salvaged scrap. Without access to advanced weapons or vehicles, they rely on ambush and ferocity in close combat to win. \n\nIn the beginning, they were a collection of nomadic tribes until they discovered the wreckage of alien ships on their planet. Soon after, they made contact with the other species of Sirius, and were suddenly thrust from tribal hunters into the space age. Now the Jackals’ way of life has been forever changed, as they have begun to migrate to the stars.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Jackals’ home world was long left uncharted due to the unique properties of their home system’s sun. Radiation from their sun reflected from the atmosphere interfered with the electronic scanners of vessels passing nearby. At a distance, it caused the scanners to detect large stores of rare elements which are used to stabilize wormholes, but ships approaching closer have their scanners and electronic systems short out completely. This has resulted in a graveyard of ships floating above the Jackals’ home world, which occasionally fall out of orbit onto the planet’s surface.\n\nThe Jackals were, until recently, made up of tribes of hunter-gatherers who migrated from oasis to oasis after their prey. This changed when the Jackals began to discover wrecked ships on their home world. The first ships were from the Robot Legion, whose pilots had been deactivated along with their ships. These wrecks gradually became a network of trading posts and cities for the wandering Jackals, and the weapons and technology contained within were salvaged and traded. The Jackals began to chase falling ships, hoping to get to the salvage first.\n\nEventually, the Jackals began to meet and save survivors. These survivors were taken in with the tribes, and taught the Jackals about the wider galaxy. Eventually, jump gates were established on the planet, allowing safe travel to and from their world. Jackals began working with outsiders, who valued their survival skills, tenacity and inventiveness for use as scouts and mercenaries. Many Jackals view travelling off world as a continuation of their traditional nomadic life-style.\n\nWhile some might view the Jackals as backward for their traditions, these traditions have proven adaptable and continue to unite them even as they spread through the sector. The Jackals have proven their ability to quickly adapt both new ideas and technologies into their way of life, but only time will tell whether their culture will survive the shock of galactic life. \n\nHow will you find your way among the stars?"
