  "background": "Dwarves are short humanoids, united under the banner of a conglomerate of mega-companies. Their armies are made up of slow warriors with powerful weaponry, which rely on having a solid long-term plan to make up for their low mobility. \n\nThe Dwarf Guilds rapidly expanded outwards from their home world, hoping to claim ever more of the galaxy’s resources. These ambitions eventually resulted in them starting a war that they could not win. Desperation led them to activate a machine that would end up destroying much of the Sirius Sector. Now the scattered survivors seek to rebuild with the same ambition of their predecessors. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Dwarves originated on a mineral rich but inhospitable world. In order to escape the harsh conditions of the surface, their civilization developed underground where conditions were more stable. As their civilization continued to grow, they started to discover and innovate new uses for the ores and resources they uncovered as they dug their cities. Guilds of miners arose to stake claims on these ores, and soon, Guild Lords became the richest and most powerful Dwarves on their planets, holding absolute control of the ore which their society depended on.\n\nThe Guilds were driven by a demand for constant growth and competition with rival Guilds, causing them to mine ever deeper into their home world’s crust. The Guilds continued until they had stripped their world nearly bare, before turning toward space. They expanded rapidly outwards, their wealth grew as Guilds competed to stake claims over new systems. \n\nThis rapid expansion only slowed when the Dwarves began to encounter more powerful factions. After some initial tension, the Dwarves struck up an alliance with the Elves. The Elves conceded a number of border worlds to the Dwarves while trade between the factions of Sirius flourished. Noticing the disunity of the Orcs, the Guilds used a Orc raids as a pretext to begin expanding into their territory.\n\nAfter their initial success, the Guilds became more ambitious and began to expand deep into Orc territory. The Orcs united against them and quickly began to turn the tide. The Dwarves became desperate to recover what resources as they retreated, stripping many planets bare. Dwarves became increasingly desperate for resources and sought to create a wormhole that would allow them to rapidly extract resources from distant worlds, even other galaxies. \n\nWhen they activated their machine, something went terribly wrong. The Radiance Cascade tore through much of Sirius in an instant, destroying most of their worlds and killing most of those residing in Guild territory. The survivors were largely miners working on systems at the edge of their space. Following the Cascade, the Guilds moved quickly to evacuate survivors and adapt to a space born life. \n\nMost Dwarves now live on mobile mining fleets. These fleets travel through their territory extracting everything they can from a system before abandoning it. The Dwarves have also taken an interest in the Zone, contending that they have exclusive rights of salvage there.\n\nHow will you extract your fortune from the Sirius Sector?"
