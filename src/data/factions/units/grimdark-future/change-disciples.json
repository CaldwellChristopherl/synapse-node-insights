  "background": "Havoc Disciples are Battle Brothers who have embraced the worship of a particular Havoc God. Individually powerful and resilient, each Havoc Disciple has been molded with unique blessings by the god they follow. \n\nStranded in the Sirius Sector, many Battle Brothers were scattered and left with little chance of survival. These desperate castaways were approached by different gods who offered powerful boons in exchange for their worship. Each god empowered their respective followers, reforging their Disciples according to their will. The Havoc Disciples are now torn between fanatical devotion to their new gods and maintaining their former discipline.",
  "backgroundFull": "On arriving in the Sirius Sector, the Founder’s fleet was scattered and damaged. Most of these ships and their crews were discounted as destroyed, but had in fact arrived safely in Sirius far from the rest of humanity. Many believed themselves to be the sole survivors of the fleet and that they were likely the only humans in this strange new galaxy. Without any idea of how they might return to Earth, most of the scattered Battle Brothers were forced to contend with their inevitable deaths in a strange new galaxy.\n\nHumanity was not alone in this galaxy however, and the arrival of these strange interlopers drew the eyes of powerful entities in Sirius: the Havoc Gods. These gods bided their time and reached out to the Battle Brothers in their most desperate moments. Each Havoc God sought to sway these new arrivals to their influence through various gifts and boons.\n\nThe God of War offered strength, allowing its Disciples to triumph over their foes. Change granted its followers knowledge and secrets, necessary for understanding their place in this new galaxy. Plague offered renewed vitality to those taken by disease. While Lust offered redemption and power to those cast out by the Battle Brothers. \n\nThose who accepted the pact were granted powerful boons by their patrons, who reforged them in their image. These Havoc Disciples repaid their gifts with a fanatical loyalty, willing to devote their lives to the god who had chosen them. Disciples began to seek each other out, forming new bands utterly dedicated to their respective god. \n\nYet the fanaticism demanded by their faith was often at odds with the discipline required to maintain their cohesion as a unit. While some Disciples recognized organization as a necessary means to achieving their God’s goals against powerful foes, others viewed it as a mere distraction, and cared little about structure that once defined their lives as Battle Brothers. As a result, many bands are held together through brute force, as leaders struggle to preserve order amongst fanatics. Others have collapsed into marauding hordes of zealots, roving blindly through the sector as they spread havoc in the name of their god.\n\nHow will your devotion guide you?"
