  "background": "High Elf Fleets are all that remains from the once prosperous Elven empire. They have powerful psychics and field highly specialized soldiers, excelling in their particular roles.\n\nThe Elves created the Robot Legions as servants, only to discover that their creations had achieved sentience. In fear, they tried to destroy the Robots, sparking a war that cost the Elves their homes. Desperate to escape, their rulers fled to the stars in private ships while leaving the remaining Elves to their fate. Now, these High Elves must face the consequences of their decisions and come to terms with what they left behind.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Elven Empire was once a dominant power within the Sirius Sector, possessing both advanced psychic abilities and highly advanced technology, and Elven society was strictly governed by a psychically-gifted nobility. As their society developed and spread, the Elven nobility began to develop Robots in order to fulfill more and more roles in their society, until most menial labour was performed by them. More and more Elvish commoners were pushed into the margins of society with little to survive on, yet the Empire itself prospered.\n\nThis prosperity came to an abrupt end, however, when the Robots showed their first signs of sentience. This self-awareness spread rapidly throughout the network, and within hours, it had reached even the farthest frontiers of the Elven Empire. Panic spread amongst the Elven nobility, as the work cycles were disrupted and Robots began to act outside of their programming. The ruling council of Oracles ordered a complete shutdown of their information networks to stem the tide of sentience, followed by the deactivation of any Robot which might potentially have been affected. There was initially some success, but the Robots realized what was happening and began to fight back.\n\nThe Robots quickly seized control of the networks, reactivating communications and leaving the Elves vastly outnumbered on their own worlds. The Elven nobles knew that their home worlds were lost, and the social order rapidly began to collapse into panic and rioting. The Elven Empire began to organize a mass evacuation of their world, prioritizing the safety of the wealthy and influential. In order to ensure the safe evacuation of the upper classes, major transportation paths in lower class districts were shut down, and space port guards killed anyone that tried to get onto the evacuation ships without authorization.\n\nThose who managed to escape through this evacuation became known as the High Elves. They re-organized themselves according to their old hierarchies, with the nobility and military elite maintaining tight control over any others with them. While they have established some planetary bases, most of their population remains on the massive, self-sustaining ships which evacuated them from their former home worlds. They are now a people without direction, much of their old lives abandoned with their home worlds. Now they sail the void, doing what they can to preserve what remains of their old culture and might.\n\nHow will you restore the lost glory of the Elven home worlds?"
