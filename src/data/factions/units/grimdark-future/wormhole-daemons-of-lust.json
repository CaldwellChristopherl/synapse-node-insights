  "background": "The Wormhole Daemons are monstrous servants of the Havoc Gods who emerge from a different dimension throughout the galaxy. Their forms vary greatly, depending on which god they serve.\n\nWormhole Daemons are cast offs of dying gods who desperately hope to buy more time for themselves. These Daemons emerge suddenly from wormholes throughout the galaxy, to serve the eldritch will of their gods, only to disappear just as quickly once they have achieved their ends. Their gods are ready to leave nothing but havoc in their wake, just in hopes of extending their own lives for a little longer.",
  "backgroundFull": "For aeons, powerful beings resided in a place beyond space, between the wormholes. Pure psychic entities, they lacked physical form and lived without fear of pain or death. Little can be said for certain about these beings or their origins, as their existence predates the records of even the oldest known civilizations in the galaxy. They observed passively, watching the galaxy progress, but rarely interacted with the species that lived within.\n\nThis changed suddenly, when one of their species died. Many have speculated about the cause of this death, but so far the matter remains a mystery. This was the first time one of their kind had experienced death, and others reacted first with curiosity, followed by horror. The horror only grew worse as death began to spread. The deaths started to mount and the rest began to recognize the signs of entropy and decay in themselves.\n\nEach entity would react in their own way, but most would eventually succumb with few exceptions. The being now known as Lust sought to cut away at itself, slicing any signs of imperfection and weakness. Another known as Change, sought to accumulate knowledge more quickly than it could decay. Plague found salvation in physical form, using its power to spread itself and re-assimilate any that it infected. Finally, War learned to draw strength from those it slew.\n\nSoon, these beings turned their attention outwards, hoping that the material world might allow them to stall their demise for a time longer. Anguished to survive, they sought out followers from the lost and desperate and offered them power in exchange for their service and worship. Those who rejected these gods came to know them as Havoc Gods due to the zealotry of their followers and the unrest that they caused.\n\nThese Gods are able to manifest their will in the physical world through aspects, fragments of their power and minds, which most refer to as their Daemons. Once manifested, these aspects are mortal, and vulnerable to death and harm, needing food to survive, and which can even adapt and change with experience. Gods must sacrifice a portion of their power to create Daemons, with greater Daemons requiring more of their essence to be contributed. As such, each Havoc God can only manifest so many Daemons at once, and must lose a portion of their power to do so, claiming it back when a Daemon dies.\n\nWhen they are not carrying out the will of their gods, the Daemons often dwell within a strange space between Wormholes. Their control over these wormholes allows them to appear and disappear within physical space rapidly, allowing them to carry out their God’s will without fear of reprisal.\n\nHow will you serve the will of your god?"
