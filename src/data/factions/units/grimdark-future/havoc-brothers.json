  "background": "Havoc Brothers are what remains of Battle Brothers which have been corrupted by the forces of havoc. Havoc Brothers are effective and resistant, bringing a variety of warriors and monsters to battle, each endowed with unique blessings by the god they follow. \n\nWhen the Founder’s fleet was scattered throughout the Sirius Sector, they faced new dangers in a strange galaxy, and some desperate survivors found new patrons who offered them the chance to adapt, in exchange for their allegiance. The Havoc Brothers embraced the philosophies of their godly masters, carving out a new home for themselves amongst unfamiliar stars. ",
  "backgroundFull": "On arriving in the Sirius Sector, the Founder’s fleet was scattered and damaged. Many of these ships and their crews were discounted as destroyed, but had in fact arrived in Sirius far from the rest of humanity. Many of these ships believed themselves to be the sole survivors of the fleet, and that they were likely the only humans in this strange new galaxy. Without any idea of how they might return to Earth, most of these scattered Battle Brothers were forced to contend with their inevitable deaths in a strange new galaxy.\n\nHumanity was not alone in this galaxy however, and the arrival of these strange interlopers drew the eyes of powerful entities in Sirius: the Havoc Gods. These gods bid their time, and reached out to the Battle Brothers in their most desperate moments. The Havoc Gods offered a chance at survival in their new home, provided that they were willing to swear their allegiance to their new patrons, and renounce their ties to their Founder.\n\nMany readily accepted the pact, becoming the first Havoc Brothers. These Havoc Brothers sought out their scattered kin and offered them the same choice that they had been given: hope for survival through the powers of the Havoc Gods, or death. These Havoc Brothers survived through scavenging and piracy, taking anything that they could find from vulnerable alien ships and any former comrades who refused to join them. \n\nEventually, the Havoc Brothers encountered the rest of Humanity and their long estranged kin in the Battle Brothers. Conflict quickly followed as the Battle Brothers realized the depth of their former comrades’ betrayal. Yet, some outcasts among Battle Brothers took the opportunity to join the Havoc Brothers and adopt their Gods. Some joined as individuals, others defected as entire Detachments. Soon, the domains of the Havoc Brothers grew into a patchwork of raiders, planets and fiefdoms scattered throughout the Sirius Sector.\n\nThe Havoc Brothers operate largely as independent warbands, loosely allied to others who follow the same Havoc God. Warbands vary in scale from system spanning empires to piratical raiders and mercenaries. Many fear that a time will come when, driven by necessity, a powerful ruler, or the will of their Gods, these warbands will unite and threaten to overrun the entire Sirius Sector. Yet for now, most Havoc Brother warbands have remained divided, determined to forge their own path in Sirius.\n\nHow will you earn the favour of your god?"
