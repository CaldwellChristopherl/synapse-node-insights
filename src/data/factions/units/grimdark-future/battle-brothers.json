  "background": "The Battle Brothers are superhuman warriors that have been empowered through gene-mods and special training to bring about their Founder’s vision of an uplifted humanity. \n\nTheir pursuit of this vision at any cost led to a violent civil war which nearly destroyed humanity itself, and in pursuit of their enemies fleeing this conflict, they found themselves lost in the Sirius Sector. The Battle Brothers have not relented however, and they go to any length to unite and uplift all of humanity.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Battle Brothers were created by a visionary scientist, known as the Founder, who used a series of gene-mods in order to enhance soldiers beyond their human limits. The Battle Brothers were soon deployed to maintain unity and peace over Earth and its nearby colonies, with the gene-mods proving wildly successful, and many seeking to join their ranks. \n\nThe Founder revealed his vision of a united and uplifted humanity, capable of thriving throughout the galaxy with the use of advanced gene-mods. In order to overcome political obstacles to his vision, the Founder led a daring coup to seize control of humanity’s colonies. Many Battle Brothers followed him, overtaking the previous administration in order to improve the lives of many within the colonies, whilst other Battle Brothers rejected the Founder’s ambitions, and soon a civil war erupted that engulfed all of humanity. \n\nThe civil war proved to be incredibly destructive. On Earth, the fighting was particularly fierce and some feared that it might render it uninhabitable, and a portion of humanity chose to flee the situation, commandeering one of the Founder’s fleets. The Battle Brothers pursued these refugees, eventually meeting them in battle at the edge of known space. They were met with a surprisingly fierce resistance, with the Founder losing his life in the ensuing battle shortly before a massive wormhole engulfed both fleets, and left them stranded in the Sirius Sector.\n\nScattered by the wormhole, the Battle Brothers have moved quickly to establish themselves in the Sirius Sector. Stranded far from the rest of humanity with their Founder slain, the Brothers still hope to carry out his vision. Even as advancements are made in gene-sciences, the Battle Brothers remain steadfast symbols of the Founder’s dream for humanity, and the their unwavering faith has turned them into a symbol of humanity’s potential and resilience.\n\nThe Battle Brothers now serve as the highly elite army of the Conduit, a genetic and mental duplicate of the original Founder. They seek to reunite the shattered human factions in Sirius under their rule, finding a means of recontacting Earth and enforcing their vision of a united humanity. Other factions and species are viewed as little more than impediments to this goal which the Battle Brothers will overcome, and nothing will cause them to relent in their pursuit of the Founder’s vision.\n\nHow will you unite humanity?"
