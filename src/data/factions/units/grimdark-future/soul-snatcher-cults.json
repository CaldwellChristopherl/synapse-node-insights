  "background": "Soul-Snatcher Cults are bands of humans, aliens, and hybrids enhanced through advanced biotechnology. These Cults rely on their enhanced speed and fanatic loyalty to overwhelm their enemies, combining the alien strength with heavy weapons that provide support from afar.\n\nThe Cults are usually founded by ambitious Soul-Snatchers who strike bargains with other species, before slowly establishing psychic control over them, amassing cults of adoring followers. Despite their power within the Cults, Soul-Snatchers must still rely on manipulation and act as hidden advisors, to ensure their true nature is not discovered by outsiders or initiates.",
  "backgroundFull": "Most Soul-Snatchers serve the Alien Hives as powerful advisors, valued for their psychic powers and intellect. Despite their vast psychic power and ability to influence and control others, the Soul-Snatchers are always subservient to their Hive Lord. \n\nMany Soul-Snatchers find themselves frustrated by this relationship, and as a result, some decide to strike out on their own, away from the Hives. The easiest means of departure is convincing a visiting merchant or diplomat to take them along, often with the aid of psychic persuasion. \n\nUsually these Soul-Snatchers will seek out people in positions of power, in order to secure their place in the new community. The Soul-Snatchers can offer a number of benefits to any interested patrons, from their knowledge of biotechnology, to their services as powerful psychics and bodyguards. Those who accept the Soul-Snatchers’ offer will slowly become increasingly dependent on them, as the Soul-Snatchers covertly exercise their psychic influence.\n\nThese Soul-Snatchers will work to slowly convert their patrons and other powerful allies to their way of thinking, carefully presenting themselves as messengers and messiahs, offering salvation through their creed. Susceptible patrons soon become disciples, eagerly spreading the Soul-Snatchers’ message to both superiors and commoners alike. As they amass a following, the Soul-Snatchers will work tirelessly to enhance their flock, using their knowledge of biotechnology to create hybrids drawing on the strengths of both species. \n\nAs these Cults grow in size, they accumulate more and more sincere followers, who are unaware of the influence of the Soul-Snatchers. These disciples embrace the creed wholeheartedly, unaware of the manipulation at the core of the Cult. Whether fanatical and eager to serve, or merely following their community, they form the greater part of the Cult. Followers eagerly seek to serve their mysterious masters and fulfill their ambitions as though they were their own. As time goes on, these Cults have begun to seek each other out, working together to extend their reach throughout the sector.\n\nHow will you spread your creed through Sirius?"
