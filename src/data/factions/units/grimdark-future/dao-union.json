  "background": "The DAO Union is a coalition of aliens equipped with advanced weapons and drones. Their armies rely on advanced ranged weaponry and mobility to keep enemies at bay.\n\nThose in the DAOU have embraced logic as the core of their society, rejecting selfish impulses. They came to depend upon machine logic to make sensible and impartial choices, which earned them a reputation as mediators in Sirius. It was only when this logic nearly resulted in their total redundancy that they began to question it. Rejecting AI, those in the DAOU now seek to build a better society for themselves.",
  "backgroundFull": "From its very foundation, DAO society required every role and member to co-operate in order to survive. Much thought was put into how best to divide both work and resources between the DAO people. As their society advanced, they embraced logic as a core tenet. The wisest DAO served as Sages, who divided the necessary work and resources as efficiently and logically as possible. Everyone in this society had a precise role to fill, and together they formed the DAO Union.\n\nAs technology progressed, the Sages created artificial intelligences in order to manage their society. Initially, these AIs were merely an expansion of their extensive bureaucracy, processing data with far greater efficiency than had previously been imagined possible. The Sages gradually expanded the AIs’ role, as they became convinced that AIs would be able to maximize efficiency without falling prey to the bias and error.\n\nUnder the guidance of these systems, the DAO expanded beyond their home system. As the scale of their society continued to grow, their AIs grew increasingly interconnected and complex. Many came to trust in the AI implicitly, as it came to organize in their lives everything from manufacturing to diplomacy.\n\nThe DAO avoided the worst of the Radiance Cascade due to their distance, but their AI began to act differently. Slowly, it began to deem a number of citizens “redundant”, assigning machines to their former roles. This caused social unrest as many DAO people found themselves suddenly without the jobs that once gave them purpose. \n\nThis continued until the AI locked out the Sages, claiming their input was no longer required. This caused outrage throughout the DAOU, and many began to sabotage infrastructure to undermine the system. The AI was not ready for this spontaneous reaction and acted too late to save itself. After this, the Sages ruled AI should never be able to perform a DAO's role.\n\nThis conflict was highly destructive to DAO society. Many felt despondent at the loss of the AI which had once given their lives direction. Sages stepped up once more, salvaging what records and infrastructure they could to guide reconstruction. Most of those living in the DAOU find their purpose in their job and social role, which have been highly systematized. Yet some feel that they are just repeating the logic that nearly drove their people into obsolescence.\n\nHow will you bring direction to a disordered galaxy?"
