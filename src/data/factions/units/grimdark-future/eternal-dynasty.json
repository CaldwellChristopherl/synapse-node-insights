  "background": "The Eternal Dynasty are a faction of advanced aliens from the Kusari sector. Their forces consist of well armed infantry and drones, supported by high tech robots and vehicles.\n\nOriginally, they emerged from a world long divided into a patchwork society of warring clans. The royal house became adept at manipulating clans, leading potential rivals into a series of destructive wars before imposing their laws over survivors and forming a ruling Dynasty. The Eternal Dynasty will go to any length to maintain this fragile unity as they expand out into the stars. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Eternal Dynasty come from the Kusari Sector, where they lived peacefully for millennia, and their home system became known as “stars of calm”, due to the enduring peace that the faction enjoyed. However, as the population continued to grow and spread through their system, a number of different philosophies began to flourish and diverge with each other. In order to maintain peace, a ruling system was established where regions were divided into clans under the nominal control of a Royal Dynasty. The Royal Dynasty was intended to serve as a mediator, and the title was intended to circulate amongst the ruling families of the various clans.\n\nThe dynastic system preserved peace for a time, but gradually the authority of the ruling dynasty began to wane as the clans continued to push for their own individual interests. Eventually, the Royal Dynasty were no longer able to mediate conflicts between clans, and conflict erupted. Over time, the Dynasty became a mere puppet of the most powerful clan, while rivalry between clans gave way to open hatred and xenophobia.\n\nThe Clan War era continued for over a century, as the clans struggled to maintain their rule over the system, until they were replaced by the next clan. Eventually, the title of Royal Dynasty fell to a family who held no specific clan allegiance. This family ceased intervening in conflicts but instead used their position to fuel conflict between the clans. \n\nThis resulted in a series of violent and extremely bloody conflicts, which devastated the Stars of Calms and greatly weakened the clans. Then, the Royal Dynasty intervened and united the remaining clans under an expanded royal army. The Dynasty refused to pass on their power as tradition required, instead declaring themselves the Eternal Dynasty.  \n\nThe Eternal Dynasty’s rule has led to an age of peace and prosperity, which has allowed them to expand into the stars and beyond the Kusari sector. Yet, bitterness remains between the clans even after centuries of peace. Much of their society still bears the scars of the clan wars, and many follow the rule of the Dynasty only reluctantly, due to their role in the final conflicts that ended the Clan War Era.\n\nHow will you bring your unity to the stars?"
