  "background": "The Human Inquisition is a secret organization of investigators, psychics, assassins, fanatics, and other misfits dedicated to protecting humanity in Sirius. The Human Inquisition tends to fight alongside other forces, deploying highly trained specialists to achieve their mysterious goals. \n\nOriginally, the inquisition was established as diplomatic contacts and investigators within the scattered human colonies of Sirius. They came to rely on secrecy, vigilantism, and other underhanded methods, in order to gather information and neutralize threats. Their dubious reputation has made them pariahs to some, but the Inquisition continues to carry out their work of protecting humanity.",
  "backgroundFull": "The rise of a messianic figure known to history as the Founder resulted in a devastating war that soon engulfed Earth and its colonies. As the war grew more devastating, many survivors began to seek a means to escape. A desperate group of refugees commandeered the Founder’s own flagship in order to escape the conflict, leading a fleet of like-minded survivors. They were pursued by the Founder’s forces until they were lost and scattered by the sudden appearance of a wormhole which brought them to Sirius.\n\nThe Blessed Sisters formed shortly after humanity arrived in Sirius, hoping to aid the human colonies and resist the followers of the Conduit. However, the Sisters themselves spent most of their time training and living in monastic isolation. To remedy this, they began to send out investigators and envoys to gather intelligence, and learn how the Sisters could best aid their allies. These individuals came to be known as the Inquisition, working to uncover threats and call on the help of the Sisters when needed.\n\nWhilst these investigators sought to help humanity, many human colonies were wary of these groups, and tried to isolate them. The Inquisition began to hire their own agents, operating in secret, using bribery, and building hidden alliances to carry out their objectives. They used their connections to carry out secretive occult and scientific research to discover more about the Sirius Sector, as well as other threads like the Havoc Gods.  \n\nThe Blessed Sisters eventually discovered the extent of their Inquisition’s hidden influence and conspiracies, and denounced this as overreach, fearing that they might lose the trust of the very colonies that they sought to protect. The Inquisition refused to disband however, claiming they had only done what was necessary. Instead, they severed their official connections with the Sisters and began to train their own agents, including specialized assassins, to deal with high level threats instead of relying on the Sisters.\n\nThe Inquisition maintains hidden ties within a number of human factions, even amongst the Battle Brothers who they had once been formed to oppose. Their unchecked zealousness has caused problems due to false leads or misplaced suspicions, but has also been vital revealing a number of troubling threats, such as the Infected scourge, Havoc worshipers, and Soul-Snatcher cults.\n\nHow will you protect humanity from the shadows?"
