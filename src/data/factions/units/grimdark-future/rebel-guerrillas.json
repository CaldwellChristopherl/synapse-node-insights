  "background": "Rebel Guerrillas are a diverse band of outcasts and agitators from a variety of alien species. Lacking the heavy weaponry of more organized factions, the Rebel Guerrillas rely on their diverse skills to carry them through.\n\nThe Rebel Guerrillas come from many places throughout the galaxy, united together by their opposition to the Inner Sphere, a powerful alliance of civilizations in the galactic core. Unable to confront the Inner Sphere on equal footing, they have been forced into hiding or exile. Some Rebels have now come to the Sirius Sector, looking for resources and allies for what most view as a hopeless struggle.",
  "backgroundFull": "While most see the Inner Sphere as a haven of peace, prosperity, and progress in a galaxy filled with strife, the Rebel Guerrillas define themselves by their opposition to it. The organization traces its origins to the Mandar sector, which fell into civil war and collapse, caused by groups who sought to break away to join the Inner Sphere.\n\nMany within Mandar blamed the Inner Sphere’s ruling Galactic Council for their support and funding of these break away elements. Those who refused to accept the resulting peace and gradual integration into the Inner Sphere formed the Rebel Guerrilla movement, continuing the war even though their former factions had collapsed. These Rebels sought out new allies both within the Inner Sphere and in nearby Sectors, gradually organizing opposition to the Inner Sphere into a broad coalition.\n\nFew in number and unable to challenge the Galactic Council on equal terms, the Guerrilla’s have scattered themselves throughout the galaxy, as their hidden cells work tirelessly to undermine the Council’s influence wherever possible. Their membership draws on a mix of those disaffected by life within the Inner Sphere, and daring adventurers and mercenaries who seek to challenge the most powerful organization in known space. While lacking the infrastructure and organization of more traditional factions, the Guerrilla’s are able to draw on a variety of species, tactics, and technology from throughout the galaxy.\n\nFor those in the Sirius Sector, the conflict between the Rebel Guerrillas and Galactic Council is a remote one, which they hold little stake in. However, the Guerrilla’s sophisticated technologies from Mandar and the Inner Sphere have attracted the attention of a number of factions in Sirius. The Guerrillas have no interest in overthrowing the local regimes, but have been known to get involved with local conflicts when they feel it necessary. Sometimes, they may serve as mercenaries and allies to local factions when their interests align, whilst at other times they may steal tech or help potential recruits defect or escape prison. The Guerrillas try to avoid escalating these conflicts, and as a result many within the Sirius Sector do not realize the true scale of their organization.\n\nHow will you challenge the greatest power in the galaxy?
