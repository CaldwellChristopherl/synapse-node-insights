  "background": "Orc Marauders are hulking humanoid aliens, whose society is divided into a number of warring clans and bands. Orc Marauders lack precision weapons or heavy armour and instead rely on their fast vehicles, large numbers and ferocity to defeat their foes.\n\nOrc Clans have been in conflict since the beginning of their history. Only the threat of the expansionist Dwarven Guilds could make the Orcs unite. These Orcs felt a pride they never had before, only for the Guilds to activate the Radiance Cascade. In an instant, their leaders, most of their worlds and even their greatest enemy were destroyed. Now, the scattered Orcs strive to rebuild what was lost.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Orcs came from a barren and harsh world where their survival was a constant struggle. These Orcs became used to lives of hardship, fighting the elements and each other. For these Orcs, honour, strength and their clans were the most important parts of their lives. Clans would work together to share their meagre resources, fighting everyone else. Larger groups rarely lasted, instead Orcs put their faith in personal trust and bonds. Without a worthy leader, larger groups would dissolve back into clans and return to fighting each other.\n\nDespite their lack of unity, the Orcs would eventually make it to space, where they found worlds where they could thrive. Clans moved quickly to spread out and claim their territories. By the time the Elves met the Orcs, they had already settled a large portion of Sirius. Orc clans' conflicts and raids would often spill into Elf territory, and so the Elves began to strike deals with certain clans to encourage the Orcs to fight among themselves.\n\nThis changed when the Elves offered their border worlds to the Dwarves. Tensions rose quickly as the Orcs’ new neighbours responded to raids by conquering entire systems in retaliation. As Dwarves began expanding more aggressively, the Orc Clans were forced to set aside their differences and unite. These combined Orc forces proved more powerful than anyone had anticipated and the Dwarves were forced to retreat.\n\nUnited for the first time in their history, the Orcs felt a renewed sense of pride as they drove into Dwarven territory. On the edge of defeat, the Dwarves used an invention which scourged the sector, in an event known as the Radiance Cascade. It destroyed numerous worlds and both Orc and Dwarven fleets. With their leadership and most of their leaders lost in an instant, the Orcs were suddenly scattered into a number of Clans. Many of their former worlds were settled by human arrivals, brought to Sirius by the Dwarven invention. The Orc clans were forced to retreat into the edge of their former territory. \n\nThough decimated and scattered by the Cascade, the Orcs remain proud. Some hope to reunite the Clans through conquest while others still hope to discover those lost in the Cascade.\n\nHow will you reunite the scattered clans?"
