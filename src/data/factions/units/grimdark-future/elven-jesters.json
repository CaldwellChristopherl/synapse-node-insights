  "background": "The Elven Jesters are extravagantly dressed warrior-entertainers who serve anyone willing to employ them. They are clad in light armor which allows them to move swiftly over the battlefield to deal deft blows with close range weapons, while relying on their employers to account for their weaknesses.\n\nAs the Elves who survived the Robot uprising banded together into high fleets and dark gangs, some Elves fit into neither. These Elves adapted by breaking off into their own bands, and became mercenaries and entertainers, travelling from place to place before their hosts could tire of them, living as perpetual outcasts.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Elven Empire was once a dominant power within the Sirius Sector, possessing both advanced psychic abilities and highly advanced technology, but when their servant Robots gained sentience, a conflict broke out and the Elves were forced to evacuate their home worlds. However, not all Elves who escaped this conflict were High Elven Nobles or members of the gangs who would form the Dark Elves. Some Elves were away from the Elven worlds when the conflict broke out or managed to escape through some other means, and sought out refuge with neighbouring factions.\n\nThese survivors soon came together to build small communities. These communities often existed on the edge of their new worlds, as many feared that they might attract the wrath of the Robot Legions, or that they were secretly in league with the Dark Elven Raiders. These Elven communities worked hard to prove their worth to their adopted homes to gain acceptance as guests, rather than be viewed as pariahs or vagrants. They soon became known as capable artists, mechanics, entertainers and warriors in equal measure. These Elves constantly strove to make themselves indispensable and valuable to their hosts, at least long enough to find their next home.\n\nSlowly, these communities reached out to their kin among the High Elf Fleets and then the Dark Elves. Yet, many Elves did not find themselves at home amongst either of them. Just as they had with other hosts, they kept their distance and provided their services at a fair rate. Some found a permanent home amongst these Elven factions, but most eventually moved on, just as they had with other factions. The Elves who continued to move on became known as the Elven Jesters, as they often presented themselves primarily as entertainers, rather than mercenaries or traders.\n\nThese Jester bands have been on the move throughout the Sirius Sector ever since their home worlds were lost. They believe that to remain too long in one place would allow them to get comfortable and dull their abilities, until eventually they could no longer be of use. Instead, they are constantly seeking out new knowledge, skills and stories to build on their own, and this variety of skills makes their services greatly sought after by a number of other factions.\n\nHow will you find your way in the Sirius Sector?"
