  "background": "Ratmen Clans are humanoid rats, originally created as an accidental byproduct of advanced genetic science. Lacking the organization and skill of other factions, Ratmen clans use their vast numbers and a variety of weapons to defeat their foes. \n\nAs Ratmen emerged to their creators as sentient beings, they were greeted with fear and violence, and they were forced into a life of hiding and scavenging until they could flee their home world. Now that they finally found safety on secluded and abandoned worlds, where their numbers rapidly grew, they seek to help others even as many in Sirius still view them as vermin.",
  "backgroundFull": "Soon after their arrival in Sirius, the Conduit’s followers turned to genetic experimentation to adapt to the challenges of their new reality. Their scientists began testing on the rodents who had stowed away in their fleet, but they had to make due with their rather limited number of test subjects, reusing them multiple times over a number of tests.\n\nThese test subjects began to grow, developing increased reaction time and strength compared to typical rats. Some scientists began to report signs of collaboration, tool use, and even communication among the rodents. Rumours began to spread about subjects escaping the laboratories. These reports were ignored and dismissed by superiors who were desperate for further advances to be made to the Battle Brother gene-mods.\n\nFeral colonies of rats began to form outside of the labs, where the descendants of the original test subjects continued to grow in size and intelligence. The resulting species had become fully sapient and gradually emerged to greet their creators as equals. The humans who created them, however, viewed them with horror and revulsion, and the Ratmen were driven into hiding as Humanity hunted them as vermin and failed test subjects.\n\nThe Ratmen soon decided to flee off world rather than risk destruction if they were discovered. They began to raid less defended ships and scrap heaps in order to slowly assemble a fleet. Yet before they left, the Ratmen agreed that they could not escape and leave the other rats to their fate. Together, the Ratmen launched a raid on the laboratories where they were created, and despite heavy casualties, they escaped with the surviving test subjects.\n\nThe fleeing Ratmen fleet found a remote and uninhabited system, where they could build a new home for themselves. Some decided to stay there and remain hidden from the Battle Brothers and those like them. Others decided that they no longer wished to hide from the galaxy. Instead, these Ratmen formed into family-run clans on their ships and began to explore the stars.\n\nAs the Ratman clans encountered other factions, they began to recognize their own former plight in those oppressed or imprisoned by other factions. The Clans use their skills to help others escape, or otherwise sabotage those they view as oppressors, and some factions have come to view them as foes and vermin, to be actively sought out for destruction.\n\nHow will you survive in a sector that views you as vermin?"
