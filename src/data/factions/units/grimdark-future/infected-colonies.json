  "background": "Infected Colonies are settlements infected by a mysterious parasites with a mind of their own. Most common in human colonies, the infected subjects undergo a series of mutations and changes.\n\nThe parasites initially existed relatively harmlessly on their world until human colonists arrived. As it infected humans, the parasites gained sapience, and as the infection spread, it gradually came to understand that its hosts were also sapient creatures. This realization caused the Infection to fragment into strains, with each branch struggling to come to terms with the idea that their species requires death in order to survive. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Infected Colonies story begins when the parasites’ home world was scouted out by a human expedition, and chosen for colonisation. The parasites managed to spread quickly through the colony, evading discovery until far too late, and erasing their hosts’ consciousness. As the last signs of human life on the colony faded out, the parasites gained a new level of intelligence through their hosts. With this, they realised they could now spread beyond their world and into the stars. \n\nFrom their home world, the parasites managed to spread along human maintained trade lines, infecting a number of ships and spreading throughout the Sirius Sector, before a quarantine could be enforced. Soon, there were many different Infected Colonies through the Sirius Sector. As the infection spread, they gradually came to understand their own nature better, and how their procreation required the death of not just living, but sentient creatures, if it wished to continue to grow and understand itself.\n\nOnce discovered, the Infected Colonies became a source of curiosity for some of the Robot Legions, who would reach out to them without fear of infection. The Robots soon came to understand that the parasites that made up the Infected Colonies, while strange, were intelligent and not inherently hostile. Both species sought to understand their place in the galaxy, though unlike the Robot Legions, the birth of a new symbiote always required the death of some host.\n\nAs the Infected Colonies came to understand their potential hosts as more than prey, their views began to splinter. Some did not care about the feelings of their hosts and carried on as they had before, while others sought a means to co-exist. Many Colonies have come to believe that it is their place to choose hosts that are deserving of death so that new life may blossom instead, seeking out raiders, tyrants, and others whom they believed they could offer redemption to, by seizing their bodies and using them for good. A number of desperate worlds also sought out infection deliberately, offering to guide them towards future hosts who are in need of redemption, and bring balance back to the galaxy.\n\nHow will your colony bring redemption to Sirius?"
