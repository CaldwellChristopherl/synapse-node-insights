  "background": "The Dark Elf Raiders are disparate gangs formed by surviving members of the underclass after the Elven Empire collapsed. They rely on the mobility of their small raiding parties and advanced anti-gravity skimmers to make up for their lack of heavy armor.\n\nAbandoned by their ruling class during the Robot Legion uprising, handfuls of the Elvish lower classes managed to escape into space. These surviving Elves formed gangs, ready to do whatever it takes to survive. Bitter and distrustful of outsiders, the Gangs persist, taking what they need from outsiders to ensure that they can never be betrayed again.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Elven Empire was once a dominant power within the Sirius Sector, possessing both advanced psychic abilities and highly advanced technology, and Elven society was strictly governed by a psychically-gifted nobility. As their society developed and spread, the Elven nobility began to develop Robots in order to fulfill more and more roles in their society, until most menial labour was performed by them. More and more Elvish commoners were dragged down into poverty, desperately struggling to survive, even as the Elven Empire itself continued to grow and prosper.\n\nAfter centuries of stability, the rule of the Elven nobility ended suddenly as their robotic servants developed sentience. Conflict broke out, and within hours, social order had collapsed completely as the Elven Empire began to evacuate their home worlds. The evacuation efforts focused on saving the wealthy and influential, whilst transportation within lower class districts were sabotaged, and anyone who attempted to reach an evacuation port without authorization was killed.\n\nDesperate to survive, the remaining Elves tried to find a means of escape, knowing they couldn't hide out long on their former home worlds. Some desperate raids led by criminal gangs managed to overpower space port guards and seize evacuation ships or cargo ships, whilst other Elves turned to smuggling rings and other groups that had vessels independent of the Elven military. Taking to the skies in stolen, salvaged and improvised vessels, these Elves would form new gangs and apply their skills to raiding and scavenging in order to survive. \n\nThe Dark Elves quickly adapted to life as raiders, honing their skills as warriors and scientists, applying the advanced technology of the old Elven Empire in dark and innovative ways. Their knowledge of toxins is almost unparalleled within the Sirius Sector, while their alchemists have also made some unique breakthroughs in reverse engineering the Battle Brother’s gene-mods.\n\nThose who receive these enhancements can be made even more powerful than a Prime Brother, though they will be irreparably damaged in mind and body during the process. These innovations have allowed the Dark Elves to survive and prosper in Sirius, even when faced with larger and more united enemies who would prefer to see them hunted down and destroyed. \n\nHow will your gang survive the dangers of Sirius?"
