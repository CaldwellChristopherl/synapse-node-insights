  "background": "The Titan Lords are massive robotic walkers commanded by the idle rich. These bored members of the upper classes wage war from mobile fortresses and view the battlefield as their playground.\n\nFew in number, the Titan Lords usually offer their services as mercenaries, but on the rare occasions when they fight together, their armies of massive walkers are a spectacle to behold.  With little fear of consequences for their actions, Titan Lords often wander from one battlefield to the next, seeking some sort of thrill or purpose that is lacking in their pampered lives.",
  "backgroundFull": "Within a relatively short time, humanity has managed to build up a large industrial base in their colonies throughout the Sirius Sector, and most of these are owned by a handful of powerful companies. This has created a class with wealth far beyond that of Earth prior to the civil war. Some amongst this elite class began to grow restless in their comfortable lives, and these elites formed mercenary corps. Many however became discontent with the risks involved and the discipline of mercenary life, even from the relative comfort of leadership.\n\nA few of the most powerful military companies collaborated to create a new weapon of war which would allow the operators to remain in relative comfort and safety. These mobile fortresses were called Titans. A number of wealthy colonists began to commission these Titans privately, and the owners of these new super-weapons began to style themselves as Titan Lords. The Titan Lords are able to go into battle in relative comfort, eager to claim glory and victory. They view war as sport and lend their services to anyone who could afford their demands for unique luxuries, contracts and valuables.\n\nA sort of code of honour has developed amongst Titan Lords, detailing how one must act in every interaction. These range from expectations of how a Titan Lord ought to dress, to how they ought to spend their earnings. Using the earnings of battle to enrich oneself further is seen as vulgar and a sign of insufficient wealth and nobility. Perhaps most importantly to the Lords, a complicated system of heraldry has been developed to ensure that pilots and their Titans are easily recognized. \n\nSome Titan Lords seek to be acclaimed for their heroism, taking on dangerous jobs for relatively little pay in hopes of gaining fame and love for their valour. Of course, these noble heroes rarely deal well with those who refuse to recognize their selfless heroism. Other Titan Lords view this as a childish desire for praise and care far less for the rabble. These Lords are content to take any work, so long as they can experience the thrill of battle.\n\nHow will you use your supremacy over the battlefield?"
