  "background": "The Human Defense Force is the military force of the largest alliance of Human colonies and planets present in Sirius. Thanks to this alliance, the HDF is able to field large and diverse forces of infantry and vehicles suited to the situation at hand.\n\nThe scattered remnants of the fleet that arrived in Sirius faced many challenges to their survival in the sector. The surviving colonies began to trade and aid each other, eventually establishing the Great Human Alliance. Yet, as some members seek to exert their influence on others, many have begun to fear that humanity will repeat the mistakes they made on earth.",
  "backgroundFull": "The rise of a messianic figure known to history as the Founder resulted in a devastating war that soon engulfed Earth and its colonies. As the war grew more devastating, many survivors began to seek a means to escape. A desperate group of refugees stole and commandeered the God Founder’s own flagship in order to escape the conflict, leading a fleet of like-minded survivors. They were pursued by the Founder’s forces until they were lost and scattered by the sudden appearance of a wormhole which brought them to Sirius.\n\nThe remaining refugee ships moved quickly to settle suitable worlds. Many of these colonies faced unexpected hardships, including discovering their world had already been claimed by one of the alien factions native to Sirius. Humanity quickly realized that they would have to band together in order to survive in this new galaxy. Many of the human settlements joined together in a defensive alliance to protect themselves and represent their interests to the other factions, known as the Great Human Alliance. These worlds set aside their differences and worked together to help ensure the safety of humanity’s new home in the Sirius Sector.\n\nIn order to protect member worlds, the Alliance created the Human Defense Force. Each member world contributes soldiers and equipment, but the force is commanded and maintained by the Alliance as a whole. The Alliance lacks much of the advanced technology of the Conduits and their followers, such as Battle Armour and gene-mods, and instead relies on using rapid deployment, heavy artillery, and sheer numbers in combat.\n\nAs the Alliance became established in the Sirius Sector both as a diplomatic and military force, humans were gradually accepted as just another species within Sirius. Human worlds grew prosperous and even branched outwards, claiming and settling new worlds.  However, rifts have begun to form in the Alliance now that the immediate threats of Sirius have subsided.\n\nDisputes over resources, settlement, and expansion, have led to more prosperous planets demanding more influence, while smaller worlds continue to demand autonomy. A delicate balance between the numerous factions is maintained by those dedicated to ensuring the alliance’s survival, but some fear that separatism or even a civil war may loom on the horizon.\n\nHow will you defend humanity’s new home in the stars?"
