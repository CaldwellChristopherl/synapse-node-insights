  "background": "Battle Brother Detachments are elite battle companies of superhuman warriors with highly specialized training and tactics.\nStranded in the Sirius Sector, the Detachments settled a number of worlds which they have adapted to their unique needs. \n\nThe Detachments changed over time as well, becoming more distinct and developing their own ideas of how best to serve their Founder. Now,  Detachments struggle to maintain a sense of unity and purpose as they become more distinct.",
  "backgroundFull": "Following the genetic innovations of the Founder, the Battle Brothers were soon deployed to maintain unity and peace over Earth and its nearby colonies. Early space travel had proven an expensive and difficult process, and as a result, Battle Brothers were assigned to each colony as a permanent garrison. These garrisons were formed into the first Detachments, serving as their world’s first line of defence against insurgency and civil conflict. \n\nDetachments rapidly adapted to combat on their respective worlds, developing unique tactics, equipment and roles to excel in localized conflicts. By the time that the first wave of recruits had been fully trained, most Detachments had already developed their own unique culture, skills and traditions, which set them apart from the original Battle Brothers. Many Detachments became symbols of stability and cultural identity on their respective home worlds, gathering respect and political influence as their reputation grew.\n\nAt the height of the Detachments’ influence, the Founder revealed his vision of a united and uplifted humanity, capable of thriving throughout the galaxy with the use of advanced gene-mods. In order to overcome political obstacles to his vision, the Founder led a daring coup to seize control of humanity’s colonies. Detachments moved quickly, with some declaring their loyalty to the Founder while others opposed him. This division sparked a long and destructive civil war which soon engulfed all of humanity.\n\nOn Earth, the fighting was particularly fierce and some feared that it might leave the world uninhabitable. A portion of humanity chose to flee the situation, commandeering one of the Founder’s fleets. The Founder drew a number of Detachments from the front lines to pursue these refugees, but a massive wormhole left both fleets stranded in the Sirius Sector.\n\nThe Battle Brothers moved quickly to establish themselves in the Sirius Sector, with each remaining detachment tasked with gathering their surviving members and settling on a world in order to best achieve the Founder’s vision. Their time in Sirius has given the detachments time to further specialize and hone their skills, building upon their predecessors in new ways. This has fostered a strong sense of independence and even rivalry among a number of detachments, united only by their loyalty to the original Founder and his successors, the Conduits.\n\nHow will your detachment adapt to the Sirius Sector?"
