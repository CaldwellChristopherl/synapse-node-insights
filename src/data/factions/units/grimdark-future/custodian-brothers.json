  "background": "The Custodian Brothers are the personal protectors of the Conduit, the heir of the Founder who created the gene-mods. Few in number, they use cutting edge armour and weapons, customized to their exact specifications. \n\nThey serve as the Conduit’s personal guard and emissaries, delivering his orders and enforcing his will directly. The Custodians depend heavily upon their reputation and the trust that others invest in them. In order to maintain their status, they have slowly embraced intricate honour ceremonies, destructive rivalries and webs of lies and secrets.",
  "backgroundFull": "During his rise to power, the Founder established an entourage of trusted acolytes. Each member was an individual of intelligence and skill whom the Founder trusted implicitly. They were the first with whom he shared his vision for an enhanced humanity, and his plan to achieve immortality by transferring memories and consciousness to a clone upon death.  \n\nThe Custodian Brothers acted as his confidants and representatives, and their word is considered second only to the Founder himself. Throughout the civil war, they served as his personal guards and emissaries to the loyalist Detachments.\n\nWhen the Founder personally led a fleet to recover his stolen Flagship, the Custodians were at his side. They met the stolen ship at the edge of known space and a desperate battle ensued where the Founder himself was slain. Devastated by their loss, the Custodians fought with renewed fury, when at the height of the conflict, a wormhole opened and engulfed both fleets. The fleets then emerged in another galaxy, scattered and damaged.\n\nThe Custodians moved quickly to rally the remaining Detachments of Battle Brothers and to enact the Founder’s contingency plan: the Conduit Program. The Founder’s foresight and knowledge was proven, as his consciousness and memories were preserved in a clone. The Conduit became a symbol of the Founder’s vision and victory over death, which united the disparate Detachments in Sirius, while the Custodians continued to serve as the Conduit’s right hand in the sector.\n\nThe Custodians continue to serve a vital role as the right hand and voice of the Conduit to the followers of the Founder. As a result, Custodians value themselves and others according to the reputations they build, both within the Brotherhood and outside of it, above all else. To ensure their honour is recognized, each Custodian takes great pains to display signs of their achievements, keeping trophies and engraving their armour with titles.\n\nWhile some might dismiss the Custodians as vainglorious, most recognize that it is only through their tireless dedication and diplomacy that unity is maintained. The Custodians stand as symbols of the Founder’s singular vision and reflections of human perfection that exist at the edge of genetic modification.\n\nHow will you defend humanity’s unity and honour in Sirius?"
