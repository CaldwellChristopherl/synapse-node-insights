  "background": "The Chivalrous Kingdoms are populated by stalwart knights, commanding masses of impoverished peasants. Massed peasant infantry move to hold strategic positions and screen enemy attacks, while knights bring down powerful enemy threats. \n\nA collection of feudal Kingdoms governed by knights who pride themselves on their monster hunting skills, the Chivalrous Kingdoms have become blinded by their vanity and petty rivalries, and have abandoned the spirit behind their code of chivalry. Once defenders of the people, they have become little more than big game hunters and oppressors of their own people.",
  "backgroundFull": "Legends say the Chivalrous Kingdoms were once the realm of dragons and other monstrous creatures. The fertile lands of the their Golden Vales drew early human clans, but these people lived in fear of the dragons who roamed the land, which often destroyed their home and harvest. The people of the Vales lived in constant fear of the creatures, and looked to anyone who might offer them salvation.\n\nA mysterious goddess, known only as the Huntress, came to the people of the realm in mortal form, and walked among them. She pledged to protect the people against the monsters, and drew many new followers from throughout the realm. She named her most loyal and skilled followers as her knights, and through her blessing and their faith, the Huntress's knights slew many of the monsters that plagued the land, and for a time, there was peace. Yet, shortly after her greatest victory against the last dragons, the Huntress disappeared.\n\nWhen the Huntress left the knights, it fell to them to maintain order. They began to compete amongst themselves for prestige, slaying and hunting every creature they could find. The most influential claimed the title of king, carving out kingdoms throughout the Vale where their rule was absolute. Their power and greed drove the peasants into poverty, and some bitterly compared them to the dragons.\n\nIt was then that the Huntress returned to the people of the Vales. She gave the kings and knights a chivalric code, which laid out a strict code of conduct, demanding knights act with honour and grace. The knights now pride themselves on following the code to the letter, creating elaborate new ceremonies to demonstrate their honour and skill, yet they rarely extend the respect demanded by the code beyond their fellow knights.\n\nFor a time, the rival Chivalric Kingdoms were subdued by their southern neighbours in the Great Empire. The Kingdoms were seen as backward by many in the Empire, but their knights were the best cavalry in the Empire even if they seemed to prefer their code of honour over pragmatic tactics. During this period, the Havoc Wars devastated the Vales, as the forces of Havoc sacked much of the lands on their way to the capital. This created an enduring bitterness within the Chivalric Kingdoms towards their southern neighbours, and when the Rift formed and the Emperor died, the Kingdoms were quick to declare their independence. Now, the newly independent Kingdoms seek to build their power and prestige in the Huntress’s name.\n\nHow will you bring glory to your Kingdom?"
