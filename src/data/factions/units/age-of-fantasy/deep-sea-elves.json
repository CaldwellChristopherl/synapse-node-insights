  "background": "Deep-Sea Elves are elves who have adapted to live deep below the sea through magic, taming the mysterious creatures that dwell beneath the waves. Their war hosts are made up of elite infantry units supported by powerful war-beasts, using dark magic to levitate over the land. \n\nThe Deep-Sea Elves are ruled by mages obsessed with knowledge, who rule with absolute authority. Faced with rebellion, the mages decided to destroy their home and live beneath the sea rather than surrender their power. The surviving mages have slowly rebuilt their civilization, still seeking to expand their knowledge and power at any cost.",
  "backgroundFull": "In ancient times, the Elves were driven from the plains by the expanding human tribes. While many Elves fled to the Heartland forest, others were driven into the sea. These Elves discovered a great island to the east of Tyria and made their home there, finding many ruins and relics from lost civilisations. \n\nMost of these relics had been worn away by time, left broken and indecipherable, but the Elves who studied them gained a deep insight into magic and many powerful tools. Some of these wards were still active, and it was only through their magic that the islands were kept safe from flooding. Soon, these scholar Elves became powerful mages and ruled over their people. They learnt to command the beasts of the sea and demanded absolute obedience from their subjects. They used their knowledge to modify themselves to gain greater control over the creatures they controlled, slowly becoming more and more like their monstrous servants, capable of living in the ocean as easily as on land. \n\nAs the Mages became increasingly tyrannical and detached from the rest of the Sea Elves, they began to encounter rising resistance and even outright rebellion from their downtrodden kin. Eventually, the Mages were faced with revolution, and even their powerful magic and monstrous servants were not enough to quell it. The Mages and their followers became desperate, and chose to release even the creatures which they could not control, though they knew it would require them to destroy the island’s wards. \n\nAs the ocean and its monsters poured onto the island, these Elves fled into the deep sea, narrowly escaping the destruction they had wrought. The Elves found new lairs in caverns deep beneath the ocean, where they hid away, as much of their knowledge and relics had been abandoned in the flood, and were now scattered or destroyed. Slowly, the Mages and their servants began to rebuild in the oceans of Tyria, jealously seeking to reclaim the knowledge and power which they had lost beneath the waves. \n\nFor centuries now, the Deep-Sea Elves have sought whatever relics and magical knowledge they can find through coastal raids and hidden Voidgates, and some say that they are nearly ready to re-emerge onto the land and forge a new Empire to replace the one they have lost. \n\nHow will you reclaim your birthright?"
