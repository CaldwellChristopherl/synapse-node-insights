  "background": "Orcs are the powerfully built green-skinned humanoids. Some tribes are heavily armed and armoured, while others charge into battle clad only in paint and fury, relying on their faith alone. \n\nFollowing a newly emerged philosophy, some Orcs left the steppes to attack and conquer the Dwarves, establishing an Orc empire. While some viewed this as a rejection of their old ways, these Orcs grew rich and powerful until the opening of the rift destroyed their realm. Now driven back out to the steppes, both Orc cultures must learn to coexist in their ancestral lands again. ",
  "backgroundFull": "Orcs settled in the steppes, as despite their individual strength and prowess, Humans began to push them westwards and away from the fertile lands of the east. Here, the Orcs followed the way of Bone, which commanded its followers to learn to fight and live in the wild. They viewed farming as beneath them, hunting and raiding as they pleased. Some, however, saw the strength of settled peoples and their smithing; these Orcs created a new philosophy known as the Way of Iron.\n\nWhen the Havoc Wars came, those following the Way of Bone sought plunder and worthy foes to fight, caring little about which side their targets were on. However, those who embraced the Way of Iron saw a greater opportunity: they could conquer the Dwarfholds in order to create a powerful empire of their own. These Orcs gathered together and assaulted the Dwarves who had remained behind in the holds while their armies fought against Havoc. The Orcs conquered them with little effort and used their fortifications to rout the Dwarven army when it returned.\n\nThese Orcs turned their plunder into trade and built a prosperous realm for themselves in the mountains, known as the Iron Empire, where they reigned over their Dwarven subjects. Yet the more traditional Orcs believed these conquerors had abandoned the old ways and would grow weak in time. The Orcs found themselves divided in two, as some settled in the mountains and others remained on the steppe.\n\nWhen the Rift opened, it cut directly through the mountains, destroying some of the Orc strongholds, and killing many Orcs in cave-ins. The Dwarves rose up and easily defeated them in the resulting confusion. \n\nThe mountain Orcs had no choice but to return to the steppe. Many struggled to return to their ancestral land as they had grown up in the mountains and forgotten many of their traditions. Desperate, they sought to reconcile with their former kin. While the Steppe Orcs have accepted them, peace has been uneasy. Mountain Orcs remain bitter about what they have lost, many of them still wearing salvaged armour and dreaming of building a new empire. Steppe Orcs view their lost cousins as unwilling to accept the traditions which had allowed their people to prosper in their ancient home. \n\nWhich path will you guide your people down?"
