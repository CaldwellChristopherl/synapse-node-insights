  "background": "High Elves are a faction of prosperous Elven principalities made up of traders and merchant-princes. Their wealth allows them to maintain elite and highly mobile armies, emphasising cavalry and archery over more durable line infantry. \n\nThe High Elves have built a prosperous realm along the coast of Tyria, though they remain a shadow of their former glory. The High Elves once sought to build an empire to rival humanity and unite the Elves under their rule. Instead, their ambitions have twice resulted in costly and violent civil war, which has left the Elven peoples fragmented.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Elves of Tyria once lived together in the Heartwoods, which took up much of western Tyria. These Elves often came into conflict with Humans encroaching on their borders. Over time, some Elves began to learn from their foes, taking metal weapons and tools from them, and they even began trading with them. These Elves started to adapt human tools and knowledge to their home. They called themselves High Elves, as they began to build stone towers and claim parts of the forest lands for their Kingdoms, driving out those who refused to adopt their ways. The remaining Elves allied with the spirits of the forest and fought back, defeating the High Elves and forcing them into exile. \n\nThe High Elves migrated to the coast of Tyria, on the edge of the Heartwood forest. They settled this isolated and sparsely populated land, and rapidly built new cities of stone and steel along the coast, while using whatever lumber they could find to build great fleets. These cities competed for power and position amongst themselves, and High Elven rulers considered wealth, intrigue, and knowledge to be every bit as critical to their cities’ welfare as castle walls and a standing army. \n\nThe High Elves sought out knowledge and skills, like smithing and craftsmanship from their neighbours, while jealously guarding their own secrets. Enterprising High Elves became wealthy and powerful, while the rest risked falling into poverty. They built trade colonies throughout Tyria, but their richest colonies were in the Dark Isles, where the High Elves grew spices and mined gold.\n\nWhen the Havoc Gods arrived in Tyria, the High Elves reluctantly set aside their old rivalry with the Wood Elves to make a temporary alliance, offering their aid in exchange for wood and other supplies to build their fleets and feed their armies. This alliance soon expanded to include much of Tyria, with Dwarves, Humans and Goblins. However, the Elves of the Dark Isles took the chance to declare their independence. When their conflict with the Havoc Gods ended, the remaining High Elven armies and fleets sought to reclaim their lost colonies, but were soundly defeated by the Dark Elves and their allies. \n\nNow the High Elves have lost their fleet and colonies, whilst Havoc followers raid their shores, and the Wood Elves refuse to aid them. Still, the High Elves seek out new opportunities, exploring through Voidgates and forging new alliances. \n\nHow will you return your people to prosperity?"
