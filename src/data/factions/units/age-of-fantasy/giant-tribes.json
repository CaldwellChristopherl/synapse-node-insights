  "background": "The Giant Tribes are made up of massive humanoids who vary in size from simply giant to gargantuan. Often employed as mercenaries, Giants rely on their strength and durability to make up for their lack of numbers.\n\nGiants are usually created through magical means, and many tribes trace their origin to the Havoc Wars, where the Empire used this magic extensively. As the wars ended, most Giants were cast out of human lands, with the survivors forming into tribes, where they work together to adapt to their new lives.",
  "backgroundFull": "Ogre Alchemists first developed magic which allowed creatures to grow to gigantic sizes using potions. Gradually, these Ogre Alchemists fell out of favour and were displaced from the royal courts of their homeland. The Alchemists and their followers left their homelands in massive caravans, travelling further east in search of a better life. \n\nEven after the Alchemists and their knowledge died out, early Giants persisted in legends throughout the Great Steppes and beyond. However, over centuries, lost alchemical potions would be discovered in crypts and caches throughout the Steppe. These potions were sought out and studied by the Wizarding Guild of the Empire, who hoped to recreate the magic themselves. \n\n‍\n\nAt first, the study and use of these potions were slow and controlled, but this changed when the Havoc Wars began. The Empire recruited wizards to use this magic in order to create giant warriors who could fight Greater Daemons. In the beginning, the volunteers were chosen from veterans with proven skill and valour. As the war dragged on, however, the Empire took anyone willing to volunteer. Then, when the Empire’s most powerful wizards sacrificed themselves to seal Havoc, the Giants were left without a means of returning to their former size. \n\nToo large to return to their old home, most Giants were left to fend for themselves. Some Giants, bitter about their situation, turned to extorting or robbing villages. This quickly led to towns viewing Giants with fear and hatred and made them a target for questing knights, so most Giants began to move away from the cities of the Empire towards the Great Steppes. \n\nGiant Tribes often seek out friendships and alliances with other species who can help keep them fed and supply them with cloth and other goods. It is said that if Giants see potential in someone, they may even offer them some of these ancient potions, allowing them to join their ranks. The Giants have only a limited supply of these potions, however, and are constantly seeking more. \n\nHow will you carve out a place for your tribe?"
