  "background": "The Havoc Warriors are fanatical followers of the Havoc Gods, and their numbers consist of everything from skilled warriors adorned in heavy armour to berserkers with only their faith and fury to protect them, supported by hordes of mutants and daemons. \n\nTheir strange and varied warbands strike fear into the hearts of their foes. Many different peoples have been driven to embrace the worship of Havoc, often seeking salvation from death, whether by enemies, disease, or any number of other causes. Scattered and driven into hiding after their Gods were sealed, the Havoc Warriors have returned in the wake of the Great Rift. ",
  "backgroundFull": "Human tribes were slow to settle the Northlands. Their numbers were always few, and they relied more on hunting than farming. Gradually, the Human Empire began to expand northward, even into the previously remote tribal lands. Some northern tribes were conquered, but many others joined willingly as allies, seeking to benefit from peace, trade, and infrastructure. \n\nThe Northlands were seen as a frontier territory by the Human Empire. Some roads were built, and a few soldiers were sent north, but in the end, little changed for Northerners as the soldiers were too few to prevent raids from neighbours, and few traders bothered to come north along the roads. Instead, outcasts and criminals would often flee north in order to hide from the law, making the Northlands more dangerous than they had ever been. \n\nThe arrival of the Havoc Gods in Tyria caused a great deal of instability, as many began to worship these new Gods. The Empire recalled many of their troops to defend their Capital and nearby regions, hoping to put down any rebellions there, abandoning the northern tribes, and leaving them to deal with the Daemons on their own. \n\nBy the time that the Havoc Wars had begun in full, most of the northern tribes had either united under Havoc or were wiped out by those who did. Some just hoped to be spared, others sought revenge against the Empire and some hoped that Havoc might offer them better lives. The warriors of these tribes crushed the northern Dwarves before turning south. The followers of Havoc, or Havoc Warriors, drove deep into the Empire, pillaging as they went. \n\nWhen the Havoc Gods were sealed away, the Daemons and their mortal followers were soon routed, and the surviving Havoc Warriors fled north. Still weakened by war, the Empire and its allies were not able to fully reoccupy the Northlands. Instead, they built a series of forts along its border in order to defend their lands. Though scattered and weakened, the Havoc Warriors remained, fighting amongst themselves for what little food and wealth they could scavenge, as well as anyone foolish enough to venture into their land without military protection. \n\nThe opening of the Great Rift was greeted with celebration in the Northlands as the Havoc Warriors regained their magic and their gods. Now, the tribes are looking south with new energy, plundering their weakened neighbours, and waiting for the chance to strike into the heart of Tyria once more. \n\nHow will you bring glory to your god?"
