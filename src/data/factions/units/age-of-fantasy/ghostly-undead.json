  "background": "The Ghostly Undead are incorporeal beings who venture into Tyria from the Empyrean Plane. Their armies are made up of lines of ghostly warriors wielding rusted weapons, supported by banshees and wraiths, driven forward by their ghostly jailers. \n\nThese spectral creatures have been thrust from their blissful state of delusion by their Gods to harvest fresh souls. Tormented by the reality of what they have become, the Ghostly Undead lash out furiously at mortals, desperately trying to seize captives so that their Gods will allow them to return to their eternal delusion.",
  "backgroundFull": "The Ghostly Undead enter Tyria from the Empyrean Plane, which some in Tyria believe to be the afterlife, ruled over by a pantheon of Death Gods. In truth, the gods of this plane draw their energy from the souls of those who live there, gradually draining their memories, thoughts, and personalities, until nothing remains but the shadowy husk of a soul. \n\nThe gods of the Ghostly Undead each rule over their own part of the Empyrean Plane, where those trapped inside see the world around them as their god wills it: whether it’s a magnificent and heavenly kingdom, a warrior’s paradise, or a place of pain and torture. Those few mortals who have gone to these lands and escaped to tell the tale see something else entirely. They return with tales of shambling spirits lurking over desolate ruins, playing out mortal lives which have long been lost. Many of these spirits have completely forgotten their mortal lives, while others remember only scattered fragments. \n\nThe Ghostly Undead are sometimes sent out to other planes by their gods, tasked with seeking out souls to bring back to the plane. These spirits only faintly understand their purpose; some believe they seek worthy souls to reward with paradise, others believe that they have come to bring down divine retribution on the foes of their gods. The Ghostly Undead only know for certain that they may solely return once they have taken enough souls to satisfy their masters. \n\nAs the Ghostly Undead wander the outside of the Empyrean Plane, their gods’ glamors come undone, gradually causing them to become aware of their true appearance and surroundings. Many Ghostly Undead are horrified when confronted with their true nature, which drives them to a spiteful madness where they lose any sense of self and lash out furiously at any living creatures. Others become convinced that they have been trapped in an illusion, as a punishment for displeasing their god in some way, seeking desperately to redeem themselves so they may return to the Empyrean Plane.\n\n The Ghostly Undead have begun to pour into Tyria ever since the Rift opened many once-hidden Voidgates in Tyria. Once thought of as mere legend, it is now not uncommon to see large processions of Ghostly Undead prowling through the forgotten fringes of Tyria, seeking to claim those who have strayed too far from their homes. Sometimes they have also been known to bargain with mortals of Tyria who can offer them magic, souls, or a means of return to their home. \n\nHow will you find your way through the mortal planes?"
