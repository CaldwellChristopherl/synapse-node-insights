  "background": "A highly developed empire in the centre of Tyria, the Human Empire’s armies are made up of all sorts of infantry, cavalry, ranged units, and even some monstrous beasts. Their armies are highly varied but lack the specialisation of other factions. \n\nOnce a beacon of unity and stability, the Old Empire collapsed when its last two heirs fought each other to claim it for themselves. Now, the remaining cities must rebuild as they live in the shadow of their former glory. The new Human Empire is fragile, built on a coalition of guilds and nobility, and only time will tell whether this empire will endure. ",
  "backgroundFull": "Humans spread throughout Tyria after they developed agriculture and metalworking. A number of cities arose which fought for political dominance until eventually one city came to dominate the region through conquest and alliances. This system of alliances and vassals became the basis of the Old Empire, where the Emperor ruled from the Capital city, supported by a council of Noble Houses. This Empire brought peace and trade to the Midlands, which in turn led to innovation and expansion until most Human settlements were united under their sway. \n\nThe Empire faced its greatest struggle during the Havoc Wars. On the eve of their greatest defeat, the Wizarding Guild and allied magicians turned the tide, sacrificing their lives to seal the Havoc Gods into the Orb of Fate. A period of peace and prosperity ensued, and the Orb and the Imperial Crown became symbols of peace and Imperial authority. Yet, the Emperors would never regain their previous authority as the Empire began to rely more on local rulers, held together by careful diplomacy and the personal charisma of successive Emperors. This era came to a sudden end with the opening of the Great Rift.\n\nWhen the twin heirs of the last Emperor destroyed the Orb during a violent succession dispute, it unleashed the captured Havoc Gods, and the resulting release of arcane power destroyed much of Tyria. The Capital, Imperial Family, and much of the ruling class were destroyed almost instantaneously. A number of outlying provinces broke away, while towns and cities in the core of the Empire were left without leadership. The situation threatened to devolve into total chaos. \n\nLocal Merchants and Guilds stepped in to maintain order in many towns where the local rulers had died. These towns declared themselves Free Cities. Other towns fell under the sway of the Wizarding Guild, who were still held in high regard for their intervention during the Havoc Wars. Reluctantly, the Nobles recognised some cities as under the governance of various Guilds, including the Wizarding Guild. In others, the Guilds agreed to share power with the surviving nobility. \n\nTogether, these cities would form a new senate that would continue to govern what remained of the Human Empire. It was agreed a Steward would be elected to rule the Empire until the Orb was restored and a new Emperor could be named. Stewards are chosen from Noble Candidates or those with some trace of Imperial blood, who have renounced all other titles and loyalties except those to the Empire itself. \n\nHow will you reforge the Empire?"
