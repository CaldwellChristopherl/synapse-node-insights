Their legions march slowly and with terrible purpose, cutting down any who oppose them. \n\nThe Ossified Undead destroyed all life in their Plane in order to escape the influence of a mighty Plague Daemon, preserving their people as deathless constructs. When they discovered Tyria, they hoped to escape their lifeless plane, but were betrayed and banished back to their home. However, the Great Rift opened new portals to Tyria again, and now they are determined to avenge their betrayal and claim their new home by force. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The native plane of the Ossified Undead was a verdant and tranquil place until the eye of the Plague God fell upon it. Under the malign influence of Plague, the world began to rot and wither. As the world around them fell into decay, the remaining Sages gathered to make a plan: they studied strange and dark magic that would allow them to transcend the weaknesses of flesh that the Havoc God preyed upon, and they would become beings of bone and spirit beyond death. Some rejected this, but many more were desperate enough to embrace the idea and become the Ossified Undead. \n\nWhile those who rejected the Sages died out to disease and corruption, the Ossified Undead began to purge their lands of life. They drove back the Plague God’s servants until their plane was saved, but no living thing remained. After this, the Ossified Undead lived in peace for a time. None are certain how long this was, as without life, time soon lost any meaning. Some fell into insanity or despair. The Sages were once more charged with seeking a solution.\n\nThe Sages’ hopes were lifted when they discovered a Voidgate created by a strange sage from the plane of Tyria, who begged for help to protect his people. After some discussion, the Sages agreed to offer their knowledge, and in exchange, they asked for the right to settle in Tyria. While they provided their knowledge willingly, the Tyrians betrayed their side of the deal and severed their link with the Ossified Undead plane once the Havoc Wars were over. \n\nThe Ossified Undead and their Sages tried to reopen the link many times without success. Their opportunity only came when the Rift devastated Tyria, and they could take advantage of the sudden surge of energy that created the rift in order to open previously lost Voidgates throughout Tyria. \n\nThe Ossified Undead have begun to enter Tyria, returning once more to a land of life, but now view other factions with distrust, remembering their previous betrayal. Yet they are determined to make their home for their people in Tyria, even if they have to fight every other faction in Tyria to do it. \n\nHow will you carve out a new home in this plane of life?"
