  "background": "Ratmen are small humanoids, closely related to rats. Individually weak, they rely on large numbers of warriors, growth-serum injected beasts, and inventive war-machines. \n\nThe Ratmen first emerged from the sewer systems beneath the Old Empire’s greatest cities, but were viewed as abominations by the humans and quickly driven out. Faced with many dangers and few friends, the Ratmen have become fanatical warriors and cunning tacticians, often serving as a buffer to the society that drove them out. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Ratmen only started appearing long after humanity and their cities had become widespread throughout much of Tyria. Little is known about how or why they came into being, but they emerged from sewer systems beneath human cities. When their existence was discovered by the humans above, they were viewed as abominations and driven out of the cities. The surviving Ratmen sought refuge in neighbouring lands, but none were willing to accept them. \n\nThe Ratmen eventually found a new home in a stretch of land that had been particularly devastated during the Havoc Wars. In the Northlands, surviving Havoc Warriors continued to raid and plunder, while the original Human inhabitants had mostly moved to the more defended southern regions. The Ratmen settled in these largely abandoned lands, and their numbers rapidly grew as they reclaimed the territory which had been left barren by years of brutal warfare. They rapidly built fortified cities, designed to withstand attack from raiders and any others who might try to claim the Ratmen’s land as their own.\n\nFor a time, the Ratmen prospered thanks to their diligent work and the region’s rich natural resources, and soon their society grew prosperous. Within their massive cities, they organised themselves into many guilds, each specialised in providing different benefits for their society, and their cities were ruled by commissions made up of the heads of the city’s key guilds. Yet, as Tyria continued to recover from the Havoc Wars, the Ratmen’s lands fell under increasing pressure from their various neighbours, who sought to reclaim it and forced the Ratmen to endure constant sieges and warfare in order to defend their home. \n\nThe opening of the Rift was the fatal blow to their former society. The rift tore through several cities, destroying their walls, while the forces of Havoc rallied in the north. Panic spread and soon, and the various Guilds were fighting among themselves. \n\nJust as the forces of Havoc approached their lands, and all hope was lost, a miracle happened. A godly figure of a female rat appeared in the sky and struck down their enemies’ army. The remaining Rats renounced their quarrels and reunited to fight in the name of their mysterious new Goddess, creating a cult in her name that now occupies every corner of their society. Her disciples whisper in the ears of the guild masters, and while many see her as a saviour, others view her as a threat to their still delicate positions. \n\nHow will you serve the Guilds and God-Mother?"
