  "background": "The Kingdom of Angels is a faction made up mostly of Humans in the service of powerful angelic creatures. Their zealous infantry are protected by divine magic and supported by Angels who exude powerful auras over the battlefield. \n\nWhen the Great Rift opened, the people of this Kingdom were spared from destruction by the coming of the Angels. The Angels brought the people to safety beyond Tyria and taught them to worship new Twin Gods. Now they have returned to Tyria under the watchful eyes of the Angels, who offer their protection in exchange for total obedience. ",
  "backgroundFull": "When the Great Rift opened, its consequences were felt throughout Tyria. However, in one remote province along the southern border of the Empire, these consequences were particularly severe. The people of this province faced a series of catastrophes, as floods, hail, and wild fires raged throughout the region, destroying homes and crops, while the Rift cut them off from much of the Empire and their neighbours. \n\nIt was in this time of catastrophe that the Angels revealed themselves. They presented themselves to the people and offered to take those who would follow them to a city in the sky, far from the destruction, so that they might return to rebuild in harmony with the Angels. The people came to know their new home as the Celestial City and they soon came to worship the Twin Gods of the Angels and obey their will as it was told to them by the Angels. They worked to improve their new city, their hands always guided by the watchful eyes of their angelic saviours. The youths were taught to view the Angels as saviours and protectors, and to trust in the words of their new guardians completely. After nearly two generations away, the Angel finally returned to Tyria with their followers. \n\nThe people found their old homes abandoned and ruined, and the Angels instructed them to destroy what little remained, and sever any connections with their ancestors’ lives. Under the close supervision of the Angels, the people began to raise new temples and homes in the style of the Celestial City. These cities would serve as the core of their new realm in Tyria, and soon the Angels were ready to expand their flock. \n\nThe Angels and their armies took to converting those who had come to the land in their absence. They offered rewards and favour to those who showed devotion and adopted the faith willingly, while crushing anyone who rebelled against them. Soon, the Angelic Kingdom began to look beyond its old provincial boundaries, seeking out strange magical relics and converting new followers, whether through preaching or conquest. They keep a close eye over their people, inspiring them forever towards greater faith in return for their salvation. \n\nWhile their followers profess the benevolence of their Angelic leaders, others in Tyria view the close supervision and strict commands of the Angels with suspicion, and some have begun to speculate that the Angels are working towards some secret ends beyond the knowledge of their followers. \n\nHow will you spread the new faith?"
