  "background": "Dark Elves are a faction of pirates and freebooters, who have cut themselves off from their homeland, and have learnt to tame the wild and monstrous beasts of their native isles through an alliance with the Snake-Elves. They are swift and skilled attackers, but their lack of armour leaves them vulnerable to counter attack. \n\nThe Dark Elves won their struggle for independence, but now, without a common enemy, there is nothing to keep them united. They must tread carefully with their new found freedom, as they risk either falling into lawlessness or tyranny if their delicate truces collapse.",
  "backgroundFull": "Before the High Elves arrived, the Dark Isles were only known through sailors’ legends and tales, which spoke of the waters as dangerous and infested with sea beasts. High Elf sailors discovered the islands during their voyages, and soon found the islands were rich in spices and gold. The High Elven Kings sought out colonists to claim these once-mythical islands, but only the most daring and desperate Elves would venture out to the isles, since most ships sent to the isles were lost to the creatures beneath the waves. The colonists who arrived on the islands had to learn to survive independently, as shipments were often lost to the sea and many colonies were lost completely.\n\nThose who did survive did so with the help of the Snake-Elves. The Snake-Elves had lived on the isles for centuries, and learnt how to tame many of the islands’ creatures. The settlers developed close relations with these Snake-Elves, trading wealth and weapons from the mainland in exchange for the Snake-Elve’s knowledge and skills. The High Elves took a more cautious approach, viewing the Snake-Elves with scorn and attempting to subdue the sea-beasts by force.\n\nDespite the dangers of the Dark Isles, the Elven Kings and their merchants expected their share of profit from the colonies. Colonists resented paying taxes to the supply ships that often were lost at sea before they arrived, because as ships left port, heavy with the wealth of the islands, they became tempting targets. Many settlers took on a life of piracy, returning with wealth that otherwise would have been sent to the homelands. These pirates soon filled the moneyed class of the islands, overtaking the old nobility in wealth and power.\n\nThe colonists rejected the taxes imposed on them to fight the distant Havoc Wars, and many began to speak of independence, calling themselves Dark Elves. The High Elves then sent a diplomatic mission to negotiate with the colonists, only to have their diplomats slaughtered, and the High Elven navy was thoroughly defeated by a coalition of pirates and Snake-Elves using the monsters beneath the waves.\n\nThe Pirate Lords’ ambitions have only grown since they won their independence, and they have begun to pillage along Tyria’s coasts and through its Voidgates. Now it is unclear whether the Pirates’ alliance will last, or if the fiercely independent Dark Elves will collapse into civil war.\n\nHow will you bring fortune to the Isles?"
