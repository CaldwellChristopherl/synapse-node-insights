  "background": "Halflings are short Humans, smaller than your typical Dwarf. They lack the heavy weaponry of some species, instead relying on inventive uses of technology, animals, and pacts made with spirits and golems. \n\nAfter facing many perils, they are a people torn between two lives that now struggle to reconcile them. They were driven from their idyllic farmland homes by marauding Giants, and after generations of conflict and struggle, they have made their way back to their ancient homeland. Yet now, many Halflings find themselves at odds with their old traditions, preferring instead to pursue their ancient grudge against the Giants.",
  "backgroundFull": "Halflings originally resided north of the Western Steppe, where their clans built villages and farmed in peace for many centuries. This changed when Giants appeared, marauding through their homeland. The Giants ate any livestock, grain, and Halflings they encountered along the way, taking little note of any resistance the villages could muster. Without any means to defend themselves, the Halflings evacuated their homelands, fleeing through a hidden Voidgate. They hoped to return once the danger had passed, only to discover that the Giants had destroyed the gate, preventing them from returning home. \n\nThe Halfings arrived in a land of rocky hills and bogs, ill suited to the sort of farming that had once been their way of life. They grew what little the land would allow them, farming mushrooms and resilient plants, while hunting and fishing to make up the rest. They struggled to survive during these difficult times, and many died of starvation and cold.‍\n\nThe Halflings encountered Havoc’s influence in the North before most, and without anywhere left to escape to, the Halflings fought to defend their new home, adapting their old farming equipment and animals to war. Their army proved versatile and adaptable, despite their ragtag appearance. While many Halflings would die during the war, those who survived became skilled warriors, specialising in combat against larger foes. \n\nOnce the Havoc Wars ended, many Halfling veterans decided to go south and seek revenge on the Giants. They marched through the lands which Havoc had destroyed until they arrived in their old homeland. The tribe of Giants who had destroyed their home had long moved on and perhaps even died out, but the Halflings still sought out and fought with any other Giants that they could find. Secure in their old homeland, the veteran Halflings rebuilt the old Voidgate. The eldest Halfling recognised their ruined homes, but few still wished to return. Most Halflings now remain in their new Northern home, only returning to their home countries in order to hunt Giants. \n\nThe return of Havoc gives the Halflings another ancestral foe to prove themselves against. Many Halfling clans still hold grudges for ancestors killed during the Havoc Wars and are eager to prove their skills against them. \n\nHow will you settle your ancestral grudges?"
