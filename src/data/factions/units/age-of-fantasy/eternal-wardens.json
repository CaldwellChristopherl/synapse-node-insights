  "background": "Eternal Wardens are massive magically imbued soldiers equipped with heavy battle armour and deadly weapons. Few in number, they rely on armour and skill in battle to overcome more numerous foes. \n\nThese powerful soldiers venture from the Voidgates of the Alabaster City to many Planes, including Tyria. They are famed for their diplomatic skill, heroic strength and hatred of Havoc. They recruit throughout the Planes, but only those who prove worthy learn the Wardens’ true purpose: sacrificing souls to protect their Plane from a far greater danger. Of course, unworthy souls will still find purpose in defending their Plane, by other means. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Eternal Wardens hail from the Alabaster City, a bustling metropolis which stands in stark contrast to the ashen wasteland that makes up the rest of their realm. The city is a host to countless Voidgates that allow the Wardens to travel to countless Planes, including Tyria and many more beyond it. The largest Voidgate in the Alabaster City lies in its very heart, sealed by the Warden God who has dedicated his entire being to keeping the gate shut, stopping what lies beyond it from venturing in. \n\nThere is no one alive who still knows the full truth of what lies beyond the gate, except for fragments of legend and speculation. All that is known for certain is that their God has dedicated his entire purpose to ensuring that the Voidgate remains shut. This task has slowly drained the Warden God’s power over the centuries, however, and the people of the city have long watched their God’s strength slowly fail. \n\nIn order to preserve the Warden God, his followers sacrifice thousands of souls each day to lend him strength. His most devoted and skilled followers are inducted into the order of Eternal Wardens and imbued with a portion of their God’s power. The Wardens venture out into several Planes to find worthy sacrifices, and either bring them to the Alabaster city alive, or capture their souls in lanterns to feed to their God. \n\nDuring their travels, the Wardens discovered that a Havoc Daemon’s soul contains a portion of their god’s divine energy, and serves as a uniquely potent sacrifice for their own god. The Wardens started hunting Havoc Daemons through several Planes, eventually following the Havoc Gods to Tyria, arriving early in the Havoc Wars whilst pursuing the Havoc Gods. In Tyria, they helped win many battles, fighting alongside Tyrians and capturing many Daemons. When the Havoc Gods were sealed, the Eternal Wardens disappeared as suddenly as they came. \n\nNow that the Great Rift has opened, and the Havoc Gods have been freed, the Wardens have returned to Tyria, viewing it as a hunting ground for capturing Daemons. However, they are now more careful fighting Daemons, not wishing them to be as badly defeated as they were, so as not to lose their source of souls. When necessary, they will even fight with other Tyrian factions, just to make sure that the Havoc Daemons are not driven to extinction. \n\nHow will you keep the gate sealed?"
