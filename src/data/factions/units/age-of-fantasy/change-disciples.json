  "background": "The Havoc Disciples are those who have embraced a particular Havoc God. Each god bestows unique boons and powers onto their followers. As a result, their warbands are specialized, shaped to reflect the whims of their god. \n\nForsaken by the Empire, the northern tribes were approached by different gods who offered a chance at survival in exchange for worship. Each god empowered their respective followers, reforging them according to their will. After their defeat in the Havoc Wars, the Disciples were severed from their former patrons, but with the Rift’s opening, they are eager to renew their pacts after many years spent in bitter exile. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The arrival of the Havoc Gods in Tyria caused a great deal of instability, as some began to worship these new Gods. The Empire recalled many of their troops to defend their Capital and nearby regions, hoping to put down any rebellions there, whilst the northern tribes were abandoned and left to deal with any dangers on their own. \n\nThe Havoc Gods’ eyes soon turned to this forsaken province, seeking potential converts and champions. Each Havoc God sought to sway promising individuals and powerful tribes to their influence, granting their favourites various boons in exchange for worship. \n\nThe God of War offered strength, allowing its Disciples to triumph over their foes. Change granted knowledge and powerful magic. Plague offered renewed vitality to those taken by disease. While Lust offered redemption and power to those cast out by the Empire. \n\nThese gifts offered renewed hope and life amongst the desperate tribes whom the Empire had abandoned. Those who accepted the pact were granted powerful boons by their patrons, who reforged them in their image. These Havoc Disciples repaid their gifts with a fanatical loyalty, willing to devote their lives to the god who had chosen them. Each tribe defined themselves according to their worship, establishing themselves through their devotion and worship of their particular patron. By the time the Havoc Wars had begun in full, the remaining northern tribes had utterly changed, each one fully embracing one or more of the Havoc Gods.\n\nWhen the Havoc Gods were captured, their most fanatical followers were suddenly severed from their life’s purpose. Some fought to their deaths, eager to give their lives to avenge their god. Others fled north, scattered and weakened, but persisting. They maintained a long vigil,  inflicting what revenge they could while awaiting the return of their particular patron. Without direction or hope however, many fell into despair. Petty conflicts began to break out between bands dedicated to different gods, as they sought to lay blame for defeat upon each other.\n\nThen, the Great Rift opened and liberated their Gods into Tyria. Havoc Disciples find themselves with renewed hope, eager to prove their loyalty to their old patrons. Yet, the bitterness of defeat and rivalries remain, as many remember their years in hiding, and they are no longer the unified force that once rampaged through the land.\n\nHow will your devotion guide you?"
