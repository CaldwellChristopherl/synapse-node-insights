  "background": "Ogres are a heavy-set species of humanoids that stand a head above most Humans. Few in number, their sheer size makes them very powerful, allowing them to soak up attacks and crush their foes. \n\nIn ancient times, the Ogres’ knowledge of magic and Voidgates brought them wealth and prosperity that rivalled any Kingdom in eastern Tyria. However, these Voidgates began to tear into the fabric of other planes, causing the Shadow Stalkers to pour into their lands. The surviving Ogres have been driven into exile, forced to abandon their ancient homes, wealth and prosperity for life on the steppes. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Ogres come from a land to the west of Tyria, where they founded several kingdoms which came to dominate the region. Here, the Ogres discovered many ancient Voidgates and relics, which allowed them to develop many schools of magic, and grow quite wealthy. The Ogre Shamans were perhaps the most notable of these schools, as they learnt to control and even create new Voidgates. Thanks to the Shamans’ abilities, Ogres could travel anywhere in their realms in an instant, living lives of luxury and leisure, as they could acquire whatever their hearts and stomachs desired. \n\nSoon, the Shamans looked beyond their homelands, to the wealth of other planes. Kings sent traders and armies to seek treasures unattainable on Tyria. While many returned with great wealth, some individuals and even whole caravans disappeared as they went through the Voidgates, never arriving at their destination. As larger groups were targeted, survivors began to return. They spoke of cruel beings who hunted them through the void, which they called Shadow Stalkers, but their stories were dismissed as hallucinations or anomalies. Ogres refused to heed these warning signs, however, as their insatiable desire drove them to seek ever more wealth through the Voidgates.\n\nIt was only when the Voidgates to their realm suddenly stopped working that the Ogres came to realise that something terrible had happened: the Shadow Stalkers had come to Tyria. Soon, Shadow Stalkers poured through every gate which the Ogre Shamans had created, destroying their cities. With Shadow Stalkers lurking in every corner of their land, most Ogres abandoned their old homes. The Shadow Stalkers continued to hunt them, seeking to kill the Ogre Shamans to reopen the Voidgates. \n\nNow the Ogres have come to eastern Tyria in search of a new home. Some Ogres have come as conquerors, carving out petty Kingdoms by attacking the remote western territories of the Empire and its neighbours. Others travel further as traders and mercenaries, selling wares, spells and services in hopes of building a new life. \n\nHow will you restore the lost prosperity of your people?"
