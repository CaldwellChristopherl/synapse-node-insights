  "background": "The Duchies of Vinci are an army of highly advanced Humans assisted by their robotic automatons. On the battlefield, they rely on ranged warfare using crossbows and cannons, supported by the more resilient Automa. \n\nThey were once a collection of poor villages who discovered the intelligence-enhancing Mindstones in the aftermath of the Rift. The Vinci have gained great wealth and knowledge, but guard their secrets and their Mindstones closely to protect themselves from poverty. However, over time, their isolationism has fostered rivalry between the Duchies, causing them to stagnate. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Vinci were once amongst the poorest people in Tyria, a meagre collection of villages built on swampland. Without any source of wealth, they were subsistence farmers who were largely disregarded by the wider Empire and other outsiders as mere peasants. \n\nWhen the Great Rift opened, the Vinci’s homelands were devastated by violent earthquakes. Soon after these quakes, however, glowing stones began to emerge from the depths of the swamps. At first, the stones were simply used to create jewellery, but soon the stones started to affect people’s minds and made them smarter, leading to a new time of technological and cultural progress. They became known as Mindstones soon after, and it was not long before the Vinci had taken every stone that they could find until almost none remained undiscovered. \n\nInfluenced by their Mindstones, the Vinci started building machines to drain the swamps and reclaim the land. They expanded their farmland, built great cities, and became very rich, very quickly. The Vinci established universities that attracted the best minds in all the land, which led to the invention of robots known as Automa. These robots assisted the Vinci with farming, construction, and generally served to boost the advancement of the Vinci even more. \n\nAs the Vinci began to prosper, they found themselves surrounded by enemies. Outsiders sought to claim these newfound riches for themselves and began to stake claims upon the Vinci and their Mindstones. When conflict broke out, the Vinci armies turned the tides and soon conquered their neighbours.\n\nIn order to defend themselves from future conflicts, the Vinci turned their cities into fortresses and expelled all foreign diplomats and scholars. The isolated Duchies became even more reliant on advanced technology to make up for their losses in trade. Now, Universities are the real power in Vinci, while Dukes have become mere figureheads. This led to them being highly insular and suspicious, with their universities waging secret wars of sabotage and espionage on each other. \n\nHow will you ensure the prosperity of your duchy?"
