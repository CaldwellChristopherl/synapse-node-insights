  "background": "Havoc Dwarves are those Dwarves who have embraced the Gods of Havoc. Their slow-moving soldiers are heavily armoured, supported by monstrous weapons and creatures created through dark rituals. \n\nThe Havoc Dwarves’ ancestors were conquered by Orcs and abandoned by their former allies, and so they have embraced the Gods of Havoc. The Havoc Dwarves now seek to reclaim their ancient homes, building a new empire of blood and brutality so that they might never be humiliated and conquered again. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Dwarven tribes were once spread throughout Tyria, but as the plains were settled by humanity and Orcs came to the steppe, the Dwarves retreated into the mountains, building the Dwarfholds. The Dwarves’ ability to channel magic was limited compared to other species, so instead Dwarves became crafters and inventors, using runes to enchant items and imbue them with magic which their Rune Masters could later use.\n\nWhen Havoc arrived in Tyria, the northern Dwarfholds were overrun by followers of Havoc, while the southern Dwarves joined the campaign against Havoc. Seeing their opportunity, the Orcs attacked and soon conquered the southern Dwarfholds. The southern Dwarves had a difficult life under the Orcs. The Orcs drove the Dwarves out of their holds and took whatever they wished from their subjects. The Dwarves held little status, reduced to performing hard labour in the fields and mines, and with their former allies too weakened to help, they lived under cruel Orc rule for generations.‍\n\nWhen the Great Rift opened, it tore through much of the Dwarven lands. Many Orcs were killed by cave-ins, whilst the rest were forced to abandon the holds, leaving behind much of their armour and weapons, and the Dwarves rose up and drove away any Orcs who remained. Some Dwarves began to follow the Havoc Gods, claiming that it was Havoc who liberated them while their former allies abandoned them. These Havoc-worshipping Dwarves consolidated in the northern Dwarfholds.\n\nWhen the Havoc Gods saw the lack of arcane potential in their Dwarven followers, their attention shifted to other mortal followers. While their gifts still appeared amongst the Havoc Dwarves, it was far more difficult for the Dwarves to catch the attention of their new patrons. In order to account for their lack of Magic, they began to use captives as conduits for powerful rituals and magic. Through this experimentation, they have discovered how to use blood magic to overcome their natural weakness. Some Havoc Dwarves have managed to catch the attention of their gods once more using this magic. However, Havoc Gods’ interest is ever-fleeting. \n\nTo further impress the Havoc Gods, the Dwarves have used their mechanical knowledge to build more powerful war-machines, golems, and weapons. They do this in the vain hope that the blood they shed and the empires that they build may finally satisfy their aloof patrons. \n\nHow will you appease the uncaring Gods?"
