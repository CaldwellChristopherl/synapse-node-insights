  "background": "Volcanic Dwarves are Dwarves who have fully embraced magic and now harness the power of fire to defeat their foes. They reject the heavy armour of their kin, relying on their gods’ divine strength to allow them to continue fighting, and on the volcanic beasts that fight alongside them. \n\nThe Volcanic Dwarves have abandoned the traditions and gods of their ancestors. These Dwarves did not return to their holds when the Orcs were defeated, as the scars of their humiliation ran too deep. Their thirst for revenge has led them south, to a new pantheon of Gods who have fostered their warlike ways. ",
  "backgroundFull": "The Dwarven tribes were once spread throughout Tyria, but as the plains were settled by humanity and Orcs and Giants came to the grasslands, the Dwarves retreated into the mountains. They made their homes in their mountains, creating powerful fortresses surrounded by terrace farms on the heights, and dug mines deep below. \n\nWhen Havoc arrived in Tyria, the Northern Dwarfholds were soon overrun. The northern Dwarves fought back even after losing their homes, and the southern Dwarves joined with the Great Alliance to protect their homes. With the Dwarven armies on campaign against Havoc, the Orcs attacked and soon conquered the Dwarfholds.\n\nThe remaining Dwarves had a difficult life under the Orcs. The Orcs drove the Dwarves out of their holds and took whatever they wished from their subjects. The Dwarves held little status, reduced to performing hard labour in the fields and mines, and with their former allies too weakened to help, they lived under cruel Orc rule for generations.\n\nWhen the Rift opened, it damaged a number of Dwarfholds. Many Orcs were killed by cave-ins, others were forced to abandon the holds and leave behind much of their armour and weapons. The Dwarves took the opportunity to rise up, using whatever weapons and tools they could find to seize back their destroyed holds. While most Dwarves returned to their old homes, some no longer felt that they belonged there. These Dwarves felt the scars of their defeat particularly strongly and wanted revenge. They rampaged through the steppes, using whatever weapons they could take to pillage and destroy any Orc tribes they found. \n\nThese Dwarves continued their rampage until they arrived at the Drake Mountains, a volcanic mountain range along the south of Tyria. They met a pantheon of warlike Volcanic Gods who encouraged them to embrace their rage. These Gods taught them to channel magic through runic tattoos, scars, and wounds on their bodies. \n\nMany Dwarves chose to follow them, adopting a sort of monastic lifestyle in the mountains, honing their fighting skills and learning to enter a battle-trance. They are eager to get revenge on the Orcs and anyone else who they believe insults their honour. They have little interest in industry or craftsmanship, instead they live simple lives, honouring their new Gods, and slaying any who would question their honour or skill. \n\nHow will you avenge your people’s honour?"
